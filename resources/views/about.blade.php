				<h1>What is Journaling??</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>
					Journaling is a vehicle of emotional exploration, a way to channel difficult feelings into healthy and creative outcomes. It is a form of free self-expression that leads to exploration and personal growth. By writing down your thoughts and feelings, you are forced to slow down and pay attention to everything that is going on in your life. You have to listen rather than run away from your feelings.
					Writing has a lot in common with art. Just like a painter uses a canvas, an author uses a blank piece of paper or computer screen. Just like the painter chooses from a palette of color, the author chooses from a palette of words and expressions. Just like a painter uses a brush to stroke his or her ideas to life, the author uses the stroke of a key pad or the inscription of a pen to open a window to the soul. And when that window opens, healing can begin.

				<h1>Why Journaling?</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>
					Journaling can be fun. Writing about all the positive stuff leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy, and you can look back on the good times in years to come with a glowing nostalgia. But life isn’t all nice, and journaling can also be nails-down-a-blackboard painful when it comes to the hard business.When life gets uncomfortable, starts challenging our beliefs and assumptions, and leaves us feeling overwhelmed, it can feel more comfortable to retreat into: ‘Dear Diary, had macaroni for lunch’-style journaling. That’s not to say that the type of journaling you’ll find here won’t be deep and positive - it most certainly is. It’s about getting past the what happened, however, and getting to the experience, the meanings and the effects underneath.If you’re looking for some proper pen-on-paper action, if you want to know more, be more and live a richer, more fulfilling life, keep reading.
